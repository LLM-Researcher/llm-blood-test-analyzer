Keep the answer in JSON format same as the input blood test report, just only change the unit if it is different from the base structure and according value after conversion.
Any unit conversion that you are not sure, please leave it as is, never make up the formula.
Answer structure: {<test_name>: {unit: <unit>, value: <value>}}
Example answer: {"Haemoglobin (HGB)": {unit: "g/L", value: "140"},...}

Don't need to explain the answer, just return the answer in JSON format.
